## Arch Process

### Neovim (Would be nice to script with something like Ansible?)
1) `yay -Syy gopls lua-language-server pyright fd ripgrep` (verify by typing lua-language-server to make sure it's on OS PATH) (verify NVIM understands with CMD "echo executable('lua-language-server')" results in 1 echoed)
2) 

## MacOS Process (Would be nice to script with something like Ansible?)

### Neovim
1) `brew install gopls lua-language-server pyright fd ripgrep` (all good MIT License or Apache 2 or BSD-3 (gopls))
2) 

### Notes
- fd and ripgrep are for Nvim Telescope and are just faster Rust-written utilities.
